        The new mental health program is a response to the growing recognition of the importance of mental health in student success. According to a recent study, one in three college students experiences significant mental health problems each year. These problems can range from mild anxiety and depression to more serious conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Mental health problems can have a significant impact on student success. Students who are struggling with mental health problems may have difficulty concentrating in class, completing assignments, and maintaining relationships. They may also be more likely to drop out of school or engage in risky behaviors such as substance abuse.

The new mental health program at Meru University is designed to help students get the support they need to succeed. The 24-hour hotline provides students with someone to talk to when they are feeling overwhelmed or struggling with a mental health problem. The expanded counseling services at the university's health center provide students with access to longer-term counseling and support.

The new mental health program at Meru University is a welcome development. It is important for universities to recognize the importance of mental health in student success and to provide students with the support they need to thrive.
